- 👋 Hi, I’m @carlos-evg
- 👀 I’m interested in computation, game design and web development since I was 15 years old.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of the area. Actually, Calculus, Python, vectors and this kind of thing.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on basic projects and develop the notions to be a great professional.
- 📫 How to reach me: for now, I'm only on twitter. My profile there is: @TheLeonohrRigby
